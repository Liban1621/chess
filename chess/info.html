                            <p>Chess is a two-player game played on a square board consisting of 64 squares, arranged in an 8x8 grid. Each player starts with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns.</p>
                            <p>The pieces move in specific ways:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The king moves one square in any direction.</li>
                                <li>The queen can move any number of squares diagonally, horizontally, or vertically.</li>
                                <li>The rook can move any number of squares horizontally or vertically.</li>
                                <li>The bishop can move any number of squares diagonally.</li>
                                <li>The knight moves in an L-shape, two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular to that.</li>
                                <li>The pawn moves forward one square, but captures diagonally.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>There are special moves in chess, including castling (moving the king and a rook at the same time) and en passant (a pawn capturing another pawn that has moved two squares forward on its first move).</p>
                            <p>Chess is a game of strategy and tactics, and there are many ways to approach it. Learning the basic rules is just the beginning!</p>

                        <div class="info-body">
                            <p>Chess is a complex game that requires careful planning and strategic thinking. Here are some tips and strategies to help you improve your game:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Control the center of the board. By occupying the center squares with your pieces, you can control more squares and have more options for attacking and defending.</li>
                                <li>Protect your king. Your king is your most important piece, so make sure to keep it safe. Don't leave it exposed to attack.</li>
                                <li>Develop your pieces. Don't leave your pieces sitting on the back row. Move them out and get them into the game.</li>
                                <li>Think ahead. Always be looking several moves ahead and anticipating your opponent's responses.</li>
                                <li>Create threats. Try to create threats against your opponent's pieces and force them to react.</li>
                                <li>Watch out for tactics. There are many tactical maneuvers in chess, such as forks, pins, and skewers. Learn to recognize them and use them to your advantage.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Remember, practice makes perfect! Keep playing and studying the game, and you'll improve over time.</p>
